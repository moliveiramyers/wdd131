            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="inner">
                <p>I am from Brazil and I live in Portugal and I love to go to the temple, this was why I choose one of
                    my
                    pictures to be at the temple. There is for sure my favorite place and
                    it is a very important thing about myself. I am persuing Software Development Bachelor's degree at
                    BYU
                    Idaho.
                    I am Young Adults Leader in my ward calling, I love spend time with them and learn of them. I never
                    though
                    of
                    studying programming before, but after my mission I felt the impression that would be a good
                    decision. Even
                    after the
                    feeling of approval, I still was afraid, but after I started, I felt joy and really enjoyed what I
                    was doing
                    mainly because I discovered two things: The Lord was with me and would help me and that I was
                    capable of it
